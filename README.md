    About APC:
</h2>
<p>
    APC (Action Prompt Console) is a large project I have been preparing that will be filled with OP hacks, an update log on other projects, and will contain links to any, and everything I have worked on. Much like a Menu for all my other sites, but also its own main network of projects.
